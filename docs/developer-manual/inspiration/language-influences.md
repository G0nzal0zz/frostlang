## Language Influences on Frost

Frost's design draws inspiration from several programming languages, combining
their strengths to create a modern systems programming language that is both
powerful and elegant.

### C: The Foundation

C serves as the primary influence for Frost, providing the core principles of
systems programming:

- Low-level memory management
- Direct hardware access
- Efficient performance characteristics

Frost maintains C's philosophy of giving programmers fine-grained control over
system resources while introducing modern safety features and syntax
improvements.

### Go and Zig: Resource Management

From Go and Zig, Frost adopts the `defer` keyword for resource management:

```frost
file: *FILE = fopen("example.txt" "r")
defer fclose(file)

% File is automatically closed at the end of the scope
```

This feature ensures proper cleanup of resources, reducing the risk of leaks and
making code more robust and readable.

### TypeScript: Module System

Frost's module system draws inspiration from TypeScript, particularly in its
support for HTTP imports:

```frost
import "https://frost-lang.deno.dev/std/io.ff"
```

This modern approach to imports allows for easy integration of remote modules,
facilitating code sharing and modular development.

### Additional Influences

While not as prominent, Frost also incorporates ideas from other languages:

- **Rust**: Emphasis on memory safety and zero-cost abstractions
- **Python**: Clean, readable syntax for certain constructs
- **Haskell**: Inspiration for some functional programming concepts

By carefully selecting and integrating features from these languages, Frost aims
to provide a unique blend of performance, safety, and expressiveness for systems
programming.
