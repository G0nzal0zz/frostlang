## Type Safety in Frost

Frost implements a strong, static type system that provides robust safety
guarantees at compile-time. This system is designed to catch type-related errors
early in the development process, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and
enhancing overall program reliability.

### Key Features of Frost's Type System

1. **Static Typing**: All variables and expressions have their types checked at
   compile-time.

2. **Strong Typing**: Frost enforces strict type rules, preventing implicit
   conversions between incompatible types.

3. **Type Inference**: While explicit type annotations are supported, Frost can
   often infer types automatically, reducing verbosity without sacrificing
   safety.

4. **Comprehensive Operator Implementation**: Frost has implemented all
   operators for all built-in types, ensuring type-safe operations across the
   language.

### Safety Mechanisms

1. **Compile-Time Checks**: The compiler performs extensive type checking during
   compilation, catching type mismatches and invalid operations before runtime.

2. **No Implicit Type Coercion**: Unlike some languages, Frost does not perform
   implicit type coercion, reducing unexpected behavior and potential bugs.

### LLVM Integration

Frost leverages LLVM as its backend, which provides an additional layer of
safety:

1. **Optimization Passes**: LLVM's optimization passes can identify and
   eliminate certain classes of undefined behavior.

2. **Memory Safety**: LLVM includes features like Address Sanitizer and Memory
   Sanitizer, which can be enabled to catch memory-related errors.

3. **Undefined Behavior Detection**: LLVM can insert runtime checks for
   undefined behavior when compiling in debug mode.

### Example of Type Safety in Action

```frost
main: never -> int = {
    x: int = 5
    y: float = 3,14f
    
    % Correct way to add an int and a float
    z: float = @float(x) + y
    
    printf("Result: %f\n" z)
    0
}
```

In this example, Frost prevents the addition of an integer and a float without
explicitly converting the integer to a float. This explicit conversion ensures
that the operation is well-defined and type-safe.

By combining strong static typing, comprehensive operator implementations, and
LLVM's additional safety features, Frost provides a robust foundation for
writing safe and reliable code.
