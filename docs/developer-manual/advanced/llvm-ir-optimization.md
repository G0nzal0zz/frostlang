# LLVM IR Optimization

LLVM IR (Intermediate Representation) optimization is a crucial step in the
Frost compiler pipeline, allowing for significant performance improvements in
the generated code. This guide will walk you through the process of optimizing
LLVM IR using the `opt` tool, explain important optimization passes, and discuss
best practices.

## The `opt` Tool

The `opt` tool is LLVM's modular optimizer and analyzer. It takes LLVM IR as
input, applies specified optimizations, and outputs the optimized IR.

### Installation

To use `opt`, you need to have the LLVM toolchain installed. On most systems,
you can install it using your package manager. For example:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install llvm

# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install llvm
```

### Basic Usage

The basic syntax for using `opt` is:

```bash
opt [options] <input.ll> -o <output.ll>
```

For example, to apply the `-O3` optimization level:

```bash
opt -O3 input.ll -o optimized.ll
```

## Important Optimization Passes

LLVM provides a wide range of optimization passes. Here are some key categories:

### Memory-to-Register Promotion

The `mem2reg` pass is crucial for converting stack allocations to SSA registers:

```bash
opt -mem2reg input.ll -o output.ll
```

### Dead Code Elimination

The `dce` pass removes unused instructions:

```bash
opt -dce input.ll -o output.ll
```

### Function Inlining

The `inline` pass inlines function calls:

```bash
opt -inline input.ll -o output.ll
```

### Loop Optimizations

- `loop-unroll`: Unrolls loops for better performance
- `loop-vectorize`: Vectorizes loops for SIMD instructions

```bash
opt -loop-unroll -loop-vectorize input.ll -o output.ll
```

## Aggressive Optimization

For maximum performance, you can use aggressive optimization levels like `-O3`:

```bash
opt -O3 input.ll -o optimized.ll
```

However, be cautious with aggressive optimizations, as they can sometimes lead
to unexpected behavior, especially with undefined behavior in the source code.

## Custom Optimization Pipelines

You can create custom optimization pipelines by chaining passes:

```bash
opt -mem2reg -dce -inline -loop-unroll input.ll -o output.ll
```

## Careful Use of Optimizations

While optimizations can significantly improve performance, they should be used
carefully:

1. Verify correctness after optimization
2. Be aware of potential changes in behavior, especially with floating-point
   operations
3. Test thoroughly, as some optimizations may expose latent bugs

## Analyzing Optimizations

To understand which optimizations are being applied, use the `-print-after-all`
option:

```bash
opt -O3 -print-after-all input.ll -o output.ll 2> optimization_log.txt
```

This will output a detailed log of all transformations applied to the IR.

## Best Practices

1. Start with lower optimization levels (-O1, -O2) and only use -O3 when
   necessary
2. Use `-verify-each` to check for IR validity after each pass
3. Profile your code to identify hot spots before applying targeted
   optimizations
4. Be cautious with optimizations that may change program semantics (e.g.,
   fast-math flags)

By leveraging LLVM's powerful optimization capabilities, Frost can generate
highly efficient code. However, always balance the trade-offs between
performance, code size, and compilation time when applying optimizations.
