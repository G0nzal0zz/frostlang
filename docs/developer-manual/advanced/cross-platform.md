## Cross-platform Considerations in Frost

Frost's design leverages LLVM's powerful infrastructure, providing exceptional
cross-platform capabilities. By outputting LLVM IR (Intermediate
Representation), Frost inherits support for all architectures and platforms that
LLVM targets.

### LLVM Backend Support

Frost's compilation to LLVM IR means it can target a wide range of
architectures, including:

- x86 and x86-64
- ARM and AArch64
- RISC-V
- PowerPC
- MIPS
- WebAssembly
- And many more

### Compiling for Different Platforms

To compile Frost code for a specific platform:

1. Install the LLVM toolchain for your target architecture.
2. Compile the Frost compiler on the target system or cross-compile it.
3. Use the Frost compiler to generate LLVM IR.
4. Utilize LLVM tools to compile the IR to native code for your target.

For example, to compile for ARM:

```bash
frostc -i source.ff -o output.ll
llc -march=arm output.ll -o output.s
clang output.s -o output
```

### Pre-built Binaries vs. Building from Source

Pre-built binaries of Frost are available for common platforms. However, for
less common architectures or the latest features, you may need to build from
source:

1. Clone the Frost repository
2. Install the LLVM toolchain for your target architecture
3. Follow the build instructions in the repository

### Cross-compilation

For cross-compilation:

1. Install a cross-compilation toolchain for your target architecture
2. Use LLVM's cross-compilation features to generate code for the target
   platform

### Platform-Specific Considerations

While Frost aims for platform independence, be aware of:

- Differences in data type sizes across architectures
- Platform-specific APIs and system calls
- Endianness variations

Use Frost's conditional compilation features to handle platform-specific code:

```frost
?defined(__APPLE__)
    % Linux-specific code
?else
    % Code for other platforms
?end
```

By targeting LLVM IR, Frost achieves a high degree of portability while allowing
developers to leverage platform-specific optimizations when needed.
