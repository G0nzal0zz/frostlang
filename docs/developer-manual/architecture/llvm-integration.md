## LLVM Integration

The Frost compiler leverages the power of the LLVM infrastructure to provide
robust code generation, optimization, and cross-platform support. By targeting
LLVM's Intermediate Representation (IR), we gain access to a rich ecosystem of
tools and backends, significantly enhancing the compiler's capabilities and
portability.

### Advantages of LLVM IR

Targeting LLVM IR offers several key benefits:

1. **Platform Independence**: LLVM IR is architecture-agnostic, allowing Frost
   to compile to multiple target platforms without modifying the compiler
   frontend.

2. **Optimization Pipeline**: We can utilize LLVM's extensive optimization
   passes to improve code performance.

3. **Tooling Ecosystem**: Access to a wide range of analysis and debugging tools
   built around LLVM.

4. **Community Support**: Benefit from ongoing improvements and bug fixes in the
   LLVM project.

### Integration with LLVM Tools

Frost integrates seamlessly with various LLVM tools:

**Clang**: While Frost has its own frontend, we can use Clang to compile LLVM IR
files (.ll) generated by our compiler:

```bash
clang hello.ll -o hello
```

**lli**: The LLVM interpreter allows direct execution of LLVM IR:

```bash
lli hello.ll
```

**llc**: The static compiler converts LLVM IR to native assembly and object
files:

```bash
llc hello.ll -o hello.s
```

**opt**: The LLVM optimizer can be used to apply various optimization passes:

```bash
opt -O3 input.ll -o optimized.ll
```

### Optimization Strategy

Frost leverages LLVM's optimization capabilities in multiple stages:

1. **Frontend Optimizations**: Perform language-specific optimizations before
   generating LLVM IR.

2. **LLVM Optimization Passes**: Utilize LLVM's `opt` tool to apply standard
   optimization passes.

3. **Target-Specific Optimizations**: Leverage LLVM's backend to apply
   architecture-specific optimizations.

### Backend Support

By targeting LLVM IR, Frost automatically gains support for all architectures
supported by LLVM, including:

- x86 and x86-64
- ARM and AArch64
- RISC-V
- PowerPC
- MIPS
- And many more

This broad backend support ensures that Frost-compiled programs can run on a
wide range of devices and operating systems without additional effort from the
compiler developers.

### Future-Proofing

As LLVM continues to evolve and improve, Frost will automatically benefit from
new optimizations, bug fixes, and target support. This integration strategy
ensures that Frost remains a modern and capable compiler for years to come.
