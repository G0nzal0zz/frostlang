# Frost

**Frost** is a modern systems programming language that combines the speed of C
with modern language features. It offers static typing and compiles to
[LLVM IR](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html), delivering high performance while
remaining accessible and easy to learn. Whether you're building system tools or
performance-critical applications, Frost provides the low-level control you need
with the convenience of contemporary programming practices.

## Design Philosophy

At its core, Frost embodies three fundamental principles:

**Beauty in Simplicity.** Every aspect of Frost's syntax has been meticulously
crafted to create visual harmony. We believe that code should be a pleasure to
read and write, with a natural flow that makes programs feel like well-written
prose.

**Clarity Without Compromise.** While many systems languages sacrifice
readability for performance, Frost proves that both can coexist. The syntax is
designed to be immediately clear to readers, using mathematical notation and
consistent patterns that make code self-documenting.

**Power with Purpose.** Each feature in Frost exists for a specific reason,
carefully balanced between functionality and aesthetic appeal. From memory
management to quality of life improvements, every capability is implemented with
both power and elegance in mind.
