[`Frost`](README.md) is a simple, fast and lightweight programming language that
is designed to be easy to learn and use. It is a statically typed language that
is compiled to [LLVM IR](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html) and is designed to
be a systems programming language.

## Getting Started

Download the latest release from the [releases page](README.md) or build from
source. You will need to have [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and
[LLVM](https://llvm.org/) installed on your system.
